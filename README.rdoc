The official HotCocoa repository has moved. You can find it here:

* http://github.com/ferrous26/hotcocoa

== DESCRIPTION:

HotCocoa is a thin, idiomatic Ruby layer that sits above Cocoa and other frameworks. HotCocoa used to be included in MacRuby but is now managed as a separate gem.  This will allow HotCocoa to accept contributions and evolve more quickly. To see more information on HotCocoa (including tutorial) see http://macruby.org.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* MacRuby 0.5

== INSTALL:

* sudo macgem install hotcocoa

(Please note 'macgem' instead of 'gem')
